Great question 👍 — this is **about environment variables**, not Flask code.
You **do NOT** put this line inside any Python file.

---

## ❌ DO NOT PUT THIS IN `app.py`

```bash
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your_app_password"
```

This is a **terminal command**, not Python.

---

## ✅ WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT IT (3 CASES)

---

## ✅ CASE 1 — LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Ubuntu / Linux / WSL)

### 📍 Open terminal (same system where you run Flask)

```bash
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="YOUR_16_CHAR_APP_PASSWORD"
```

Example:

```bash
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="abcd1234efgh5678"
```

Then run Flask:

```bash
python app.py
```

⚠️ This variable exists **only in that terminal session**.

---

## ✅ CASE 2 — MAKE IT PERMANENT (Recommended for local dev)

### 📍 Open your shell config file

For **bash**:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

For **zsh**:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

### 📍 Add at the bottom:

```bash
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="YOUR_16_CHAR_APP_PASSWORD"
```

Save → restart terminal → run Flask.

---

## ✅ CASE 3 — DEPLOYMENT (Render / Railway / etc.)

### 📍 Dashboard → Environment Variables

| Key            | Value             |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| EMAIL_PASSWORD | your_app_password |

No terminal command needed.

---

## ✅ WHAT YOUR `app.py` SHOULD LOOK LIKE

At top of file:

```python
import os

EMAIL_PASSWORD = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
```

❗ If `EMAIL_PASSWORD` is `None`, email will fail.

---

## 🧪 QUICK TEST (IMPORTANT)

Run:

```bash
echo $EMAIL_PASSWORD
```

If it prints your password → ✅ working
If empty → ❌ not set

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

✔ Keeps secrets out of GitHub
✔ Industry best practice
✔ Required for deployment
✔ Shows real backend knowledge

## 🚀 NEXT STEP

If you want, I can help you:

* Use `.env` file safely
* Configure Render deployment
* Switch to SendGrid

Just tell me 👍
